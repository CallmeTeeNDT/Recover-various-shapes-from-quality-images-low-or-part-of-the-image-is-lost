# Recover-various-shapes-from-quality-images-low-or-part-of-the-image-is-lost
This project was a collaborative assignment carried out by my teammates and me as part of the Digital Image Processing course. The primary objective of this endeavor was to deepen our understanding of advanced image restoration techniques through a focused, hands-on application. While the scale of the project was modest, it served as a valuable opportunity to integrate both theoretical knowledge and practical skills gained throughout the course.

Our study was primarily grounded in the concepts presented in the textbook Digital Image Processing (Fourth Edition) by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods, which provided a comprehensive foundation in image enhancement, restoration, and analysis. To further expand our perspective and explore cutting-edge approaches in the field, we also reviewed the scientific article titled "Shape Recovery on Low-Quality or Missing Images" authored by Zhaozhuo Xu, Chenyu You, and Zixian Chai. This research offered significant insights into state-of-the-art methodologies for reconstructing missing or degraded visual information, particularly in the context of shape and structural restoration.

The core objective of our project revolved around exploring and simulating methods for recovering image data that has been blurred or partially lostâ€”an area of critical importance in various real-world applications such as medical imaging, surveillance, and digital forensics. To implement and test these restoration techniques, we utilized Python programming, taking advantage of its robust libraries and tools for image processing. Through simulation, we were able to visualize and evaluate the effectiveness of the methods under different conditions of image degradation.
